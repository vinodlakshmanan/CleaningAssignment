# Getting and Cleaning Data Project - Coursera JHU Project
## Goals
Using the wearable data present  [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), perform the below activities
1) Provide a tidy data set by
  * Merging the test and training sets  
  * Extract measurements related to mean and standard-deviations
  * Provide descriptive names for activities against which the measurements have been done for different subject IDs
  * Label the data set descriptive / intuitive variable names
  * Create a send data set which averages each variable by activity and subject
 
2) Provide a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis. The script should be called run_analysis.R
3) Provide a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
4) Provide a Readme which describes the solution
